## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently building AccessToGo, an intelligent access control system for residential communities that combines WhatsApp automation, IoT, and computer vision.

🚗 The platform is composed of two main components:

Car System Access: a WhatsApp-based chatbot that allows residents to register vehicles, manage users, and grant or revoke access permissions in a simple and intuitive way.
LPR (License Plate Recognition): an automated vehicle recognition system that detects authorized cars in real time and enables seamless access to residential areas.
